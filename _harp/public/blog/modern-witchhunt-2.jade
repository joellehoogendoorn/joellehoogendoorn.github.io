	p   With my laptop back on track (old motherboard, Rest in Peace) I’m back with updates of my latest big painting "The Modern Witch hunt".  

	p  Been working on it for a while, and I’m now in the phase where I feel that all the pieces are falling together. This painting is for me an example of that I never know how a painting will turn out. A part of painting that makes painting so beautiful I think.
	
	p 	When I was about 15 years old, painting in my bedroom, I used to sketch everything out and didn’t let any aspect of the painting free for experimenting or improvising. But me being 15 years old is a while ago, and as I grow as a painter I came to love the action-reaction aspect of making a painting. Because I do something, I know what to do next and so on and on. And that’s why a painting always turns out different than what you expect/have in mind. 

	p 	I always try to be critic on my work and find ways to improve myself. This painting was a bit of an experiment for me. My paintings are mostly, especially the big ones, crowded with a lot of colors. In the beginning of this painting, I was curious how it would be if I would try to make it a bit more "silent". Now I think I did this a bit too drastic because the image itself was less crowded and I also used a different color palette. After a lot of thinking and talking about it with my co-promotor, I came to the conclusion that it didn’t feel like a painting of mine. The bright colors and a lot of other aspects are something that make the painting mine. As I grow as a painter, I will (maybe some day haha) come to the age that I’m seeking for a more silent approach, only paint the pure aspect of something. But now I simply don’t. It’s a conscious decision.

	p 	I’m not a very extravert person, on the contrary, even a bit shy sometimes, but in my mind there is a lot going on and that’s all coming together in my paintings.

	p 	So, below are pictures of different phases of the painting. I’m still going to work out some details and small parts. The photos are taken with my (yellow) Iphone 5c, I hope that explains the medium quality ☺. But in the meanwhile:
